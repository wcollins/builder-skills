description: Explore an Itential Platform — authenticate, pull platform data, and browse capabilities freely. Use for ad-hoc investigation, freestyle building, or understanding what's available before starting a delivery. Not part of the delivery lifecycle.
argument-hint: "[use-case-name or environment]"

# Explore

**Path:** Freeform — not part of the delivery lifecycle
**Owns:** Auth, environment discovery, freestyle skill use
**Use when:** You want to browse adapters, try tasks, build something experimental, or understand the platform before committing to a spec

---

## What This Does

Connects you to a platform, pulls everything needed to work freely, and routes you to the right skill for whatever you want to do.

```

    ├── Pull platform data
    ├── Summarize environment
    └── Use skills directly
```

## Step 1: Authenticate

Check for credentials in this order:
1. `{use-case}/.env` — use-case-specific
2. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/environments/*.env` — pre-configured environments at repo root

If found, authenticate automatically. If not, ask:
1. Platform URL
2. Credentials (username/password or client_id/secret)

**Local Development (username/password):**
```
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "admin", "password": "admin"}
```
Returns a token string. Use as query parameter: `?token=TOKEN`

**Cloud / OAuth:**
```
POST /oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials
```
Returns `{"access_token": "..."}`. Use as Bearer header.

Save to `.auth.json`:
```json
{
  "platform_url": "https://...",
  "auth_method": "oauth",
  "token": "eyJhbG...",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-25T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## Step 2: Pull Platform Data

Run in two groups. Do not run all in one parallel batch — if one fails, parallel cancellation kills the others.

**Group 1 (core — run in parallel):**
```bash
curl -s "{BASE}/help/openapi?url={ENCODED_BASE}&token=TOKEN" > {use-case}/openapi.json
curl -s "{BASE}/workflow_builder/tasks/list?token=TOKEN"     > {use-case}/tasks.json
curl -s "{BASE}/automation-studio/apps/list?token=TOKEN"    > {use-case}/apps.json
curl -s "{BASE}/health/adapters?token=TOKEN"                > {use-case}/adapters.json
curl -s "{BASE}/health/applications?token=TOKEN"            > {use-case}/applications.json
```

**Group 2 (environment-specific — run in parallel after Group 1):**

Devices (note: POST, not GET):
```bash
curl -s -w "\n%{http_code}" -X POST "{BASE}/configuration_manager/devices?token=TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"options":{"start":0,"limit":1000,"sort":[{"name":1}],"order":"ascending"}}' \
  > {use-case}/devices.json
```

Existing workflows:
```bash
curl -s "{BASE}/automation-studio/workflows?limit=500&token=TOKEN" > {use-case}/workflows.json
```

Before parsing any saved file, validate JSON:
```bash
jq type {use-case}/devices.json 2>/dev/null || echo "empty"
```
If invalid, treat as no data — don't block.

---

## Step 3: Present Summary

Show:
- Adapters: name, state, connection
- Apps: count, key platform apps running
- Tasks: count
- Devices: count and OS types (if available)
- Existing workflows: count

---

## Step 4: Route to Skills

Point to the right skill for what the engineer wants to do:

| I want to... | Use |
|-------------|-----|
| Build workflows, templates, or projects | `/builder-agent` |
| Manage devices, backups, diffs | `/itential-devices` |
| Build compliance and golden config | `/itential-golden-config` |
| Build IAG services (Python, Ansible, OpenTofu) | `/iag` |
| Create AI agents | `/flowagent` |
| Manage lifecycle resources | `/itential-lcm` |
| Manage device inventories (IAG5) | `/itential-inventory` |

## Gotchas

- OAuth MUST use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, not JSON
- Tokens expire mid-session — re-authenticate silently from `.env` on auth errors
- OpenAPI spec is ~1.5MB — search locally with `jq`, never load into context
- `tasks/list` `app` field has WRONG casing for adapters — use `apps/list` for correct names
- Devices endpoint is POST not GET — body required
