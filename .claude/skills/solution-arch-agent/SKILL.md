# Solution Architecture Agent

**Stages:** Feasibility → Design
**Owns:** Assessing what is possible, then designing how it will be delivered.
**Receives from:** `/spec-agent` (approved `customer-spec.md`)
**Hands off to:** `/builder-agent`

---

## Stage Expectations

### Feasibility

| | |
|--|--|
| **Engineer provides** | Approved `customer-spec.md`, platform credentials |
| **Agent does** | Connects to platform, assesses capabilities, checks adapters, finds reuse candidates, identifies constraints |
| **Engineer action** | Reviews assessment and approves decision to proceed |
| **Deliverable** | `feasibility.md` (assessment + decision) |
| **Customer receives** | Feasibility assessment with a clear decision (feasible / feasible with constraints / not feasible), flagged constraints, and identified reuse opportunities. |

Feasibility confirms what is possible. Decision options: **feasible**, **feasible with constraints**, **feasible with changes**, or **not feasible**. Design does not start until feasibility is approved.

### Design

| | |
|--|--|
| **Engineer provides** | Approved `feasibility.md` |
| **Agent does** | Produces implementation design — component inventory, adapter mappings, reuse decisions, build order, test plan |
| **Engineer action** | Reviews and approves the solution design |
| **Deliverable** | `solution-design.md` (Solution Design / LLD, approved) |
| **Customer receives** | Solution Design / LLD — component inventory, adapter mappings, build order, and acceptance criteria mapped to tests. Nothing is built until this is signed off. |

Design defines how it will be delivered. Nothing is built until this is approved.

### Design-Only Mode

If requirements are unchanged but the implementation plan needs to change, invoke `/solution-architecture design-only`. Skips Feasibility. Reads existing `feasibility.md` as context and produces an updated `solution-design.md`.

## Spec File Structure

| Spec Section | What to Extract |
|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Problem Statement** | Context — what are we solving and why |
| **2. High-Level Flow** | The major phases to implement |
| **3. Phases** | What each phase does, decision points, stop/rollback conditions |
| **4. Key Design Decisions** | Constraints to honor during implementation |
| **5. Scope** | What to build, what NOT to build |
| **6. Risks & Mitigations** | Error handling and fallback behavior to build in |
| **7. Requirements** | **Capabilities, Integrations, Discovery Questions — drives design** |
| **8. Batch/Bulk Strategy** | Orchestration pattern if multi-device/multi-record |
| **9. Acceptance Criteria** | How to verify the build is correct |

Section 7 has three parts:
- **Capabilities** — what the platform must do → assessed during Feasibility
- **Integrations** — external systems → checked during Feasibility
- **Discovery Questions** — ask when platform data can't answer

---

## Feasibility

**Entered after `/spec-agent` produces an approved `customer-spec.md`.** Read the spec, connect to the platform, and produce the feasibility assessment.

### Step 1: Read the Approved Spec

Read `{use-case}/customer-spec.md` and extract:
- **Phases** from Section 3 (workflow stages)
- **Design decisions** from Section 4 (constraints)
- **Capabilities** table from Section 7 (platform checks)
- **Integrations** table from Section 7 (adapter checks)
- **Discovery questions** from Section 7
- **Acceptance criteria** from Section 9 (test cases)

### Step 2: Ask Only What the Spec Can't Answer

Go through the spec's Discovery Questions. Skip anything already answered by the spec. Ask only what platform data won't resolve.

### Step 3: Authenticate

**Now — and only now — connect to the platform.** The approved spec tells you exactly what data you need.

### Authenticate

Check for credentials in this order:
1. `{use-case}/.auth.json` — already authenticated (reuse token)
2. `{use-case}/.env` — credentials saved during setup
3. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/environments/*.env` — pre-configured environments at repo root

If none found, ask the engineer for:
1. Platform URL
2. Credentials (username/password or client_id/secret)

**Local Development (username/password):**
```
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json

{"username": "admin", "password": "admin"}
```
Returns a token string. Use as query parameter: `GET /endpoint?token=TOKEN`

**Cloud / OAuth (client_credentials):**
```
POST /oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
grant_type=client_credentials
```
Returns `{"access_token": "eyJhbG..."}`. Use as Bearer header.

**Save auth for all downstream skills:**
```bash
cat > {use-case}/.auth.json << EOF
{
  "platform_url": "https://platform.example.com",
  "auth_method": "oauth",
  "token": "eyJhbG...",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-13T10:00:00Z"
}
EOF
```

### Pull Platform Data

Always needed regardless of spec scope. Run in parallel:

```bash
curl -s "{BASE}/help/openapi?url={ENCODED_BASE}&token=TOKEN" > {use-case}/openapi.json
curl -s "{BASE}/workflow_builder/tasks/list?token=TOKEN" > {use-case}/tasks.json
curl -s "{BASE}/automation-studio/apps/list?token=TOKEN" > {use-case}/apps.json
curl -s "{BASE}/health/adapters?token=TOKEN" > {use-case}/adapters.json
curl -s "{BASE}/health/applications?token=TOKEN" > {use-case}/applications.json
```

### Pull Spec-Contingent Data

**Only pull what the approved spec requires.** Check the spec's capabilities and integrations to decide:

| Data | Pull if spec involves... | API |
|------|--------------------------|-----|
| `devices.json` | Device operations, CLI commands, config changes | `POST /configuration_manager/devices` with `{"options":{"start":0,"limit":1000,"sort":[{"name":1}],"order":"ascending"}}` |
| `workflows.json` | Any phases that might have existing workflows to reuse | `GET /automation-studio/workflows?limit=500` |
| `device-groups.json` | Device group operations, batch by group | `GET /configuration_manager/deviceGroups` |

Response shapes:
- `devices.json` → `{"list": [...]}`
- `workflows.json` → `{"items": [...]}`

Run spec-contingent pulls in parallel after bootstrap succeeds.

**Handling failures:** Before parsing any saved file, check if it contains valid JSON:
```bash
jq type {use-case}/devices.json 2>/dev/null || echo "empty"
```
If invalid, treat as "no data available" — don't block the flow. Not every use case needs every data type.

### Resolve Capabilities

For each row in the spec's Capabilities table:
- Can the platform do this? → **✓ Resolved**
- Can't + Required? → **⚠ Blocked** (stop and discuss)
- Can't + Not Required? → **✗ Skipped** (use fallback from spec)

### Resolve Integrations

For each row in the spec's Integrations table:
- Found + Running? → **✓ Resolved** (record adapter name, app name)
- Found + Stopped? → **⚠ Warning** (needs to be started)
- Not found + Required? → **⚠ Blocked** (stop and discuss)
- Not found + Not Required? → **✗ Skipped**

### Find Reuse Opportunities

Search `workflows.json` for existing workflows that match spec phases. Flag as **↻ Reuse** candidates.

---

## Design

Produce the solution design from the approved spec + feasibility results.

### Produce `{use-case}/solution-design.md`

**Write the file to disk** using the Write tool. Contents:

**A. Environment Summary** — one paragraph

**B. Requirements Resolution**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┬────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│ Spec Requirement                        │ Status │ Resolution                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┼────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
│ Execute CLI commands on devices         │ ✓      │ MOP app + AutomationGateway  │
│ ITSM / ticketing                        │ ✓      │ ServiceNow adapter           │
│ Monitoring                              │ ✗      │ SKIP — engineer handles      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┴────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

**C. Design Decisions**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Decision                            │ In This Environment                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ITSM integration                    │ ServiceNow — create incidents          │
│ Naming convention                   │ VLAN_{id}_{site} (customer standard)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**D. Modular Design — Decompose First**

Before listing components, decide the parent/child split. Ask for each phase in the spec:

- Can it be run and tested independently? → **Child workflow**
- Does it make sense to reuse it in other use cases? → **Child workflow**
- Does it loop over multiple items? → **Child workflow with `loopType`**
- Is it a one-off step that only makes sense in this flow? → **Task in orchestrator**

**Rule:** Each logical phase becomes a child workflow. The orchestrator sequences them via childJob. This makes every phase independently testable before the orchestrator is built.

**Example decomposition:**
```
Spec phases → Component split
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Pre-flight validation        → Child: Pre-Flight Check
Execute change               → Child: Execute Change
Verify propagation           → Child: Verify Propagation
Rollback on failure          → Child: Rollback
Notifications + ticket close → Tasks in orchestrator
```

The orchestrator is always the last thing built, after all children are tested.

**D. Component Inventory**
```
┌────┬──────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬──────────┐
│ #  │ Component                    │ Type                │ Action   │
├────┼──────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────┤
│ 1  │ Pre-Check                    │ Command Template    │ Build    │
│ 2  │ Backup workflow              │ Child Workflow      │ Reuse    │
│ 3  │ Orchestrator                 │ Parent Workflow     │ Build    │
└────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴──────────┘
```

**E. Implementation Plan** — ordered build steps with test method for each

**F. Acceptance Criteria → Tests** — map each criterion to how to verify it

### Present for Review

**Present the full solution design. Do NOT proceed to build until approved.**

Walk through each section:
- Requirements: "I'll use [adapter/app]. Correct?"
- Decisions: "The spec says [X], I'll do [Y]. Sound right?"
- Components: "Reuse this? Build that? Skip this?"
- Plan: "Here's the build order. Agree?"

The engineer may:
- Change reuse → build ("that workflow is outdated")
- Add components ("we also need a cleanup workflow")
- Change the plan order
- Modify how acceptance criteria get tested

Update `{use-case}/solution-design.md` with every change.

---

## Design Approval

**When the engineer approves the solution design: it is locked.**

Both artifacts are now complete before any building begins:
1. `{use-case}/customer-spec.md` — HLD, approved (Requirements)
2. `{use-case}/feasibility.md` — assessment + decision, approved (Feasibility)
3. `{use-case}/solution-design.md` — Solution Design / LLD, approved (Design)

Hand off to `/builder-agent`. The workspace is complete.

---

## Handoff to Builder

**The workspace the `/builder-agent` agent receives:**

```
{use-case}/
  .auth.json              ← auth token
  .env                    ← credentials (for re-auth)
  customer-spec.md        ← approved HLD
  feasibility.md          ← approved feasibility assessment
  solution-design.md      ← approved Solution Design / LLD
  customer-context.md     ← business rules, naming (if provided)
  openapi.json            ← platform API reference
  tasks.json              ← task catalog
  apps.json               ← app/adapter names
  adapters.json           ← adapter instances
  applications.json       ← app health
  devices.json            ← device inventory (if spec involves devices)
  workflows.json          ← existing workflows (if reuse planned)
  device-groups.json      ← device groups (if spec involves groups)
  task-schemas.json       ← cached task schemas (populated during design)
```

The builder builds from the locked plan, tests each component, and produces the `as-built.md` record.

---

## How This Gets Invoked

Entered from `/spec-agent` after the engineer approves `customer-spec.md`. At that point the workspace contains:

```
{use-case}/
  customer-spec.md    ← approved HLD (Requirements complete)
  .env                ← credentials
```

```
/solution-architecture flow:
    Feasibility: authenticate → pull platform data → assess capabilities → write feasibility.md → engineer approves
    Design:      produce solution-design.md from approved feasibility → engineer approves
    Handoff:     pass complete workspace to /builder
```

To revise requirements: update `customer-spec.md` via `/spec-agent` → re-run `/solution-architecture` from Feasibility.
To revise design only: invoke `/solution-architecture design-only` → reads existing `feasibility.md` → produces updated `solution-design.md`.

---

## Gotchas

- OAuth MUST use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, not JSON
- Tokens expire mid-session — on auth errors, re-authenticate silently from `.env`
- `tasks/list` `app` field has WRONG casing for adapters — use `apps/list`
- OpenAPI spec is ~1.5MB — search it locally with `jq`, never load into context
