## Contributing Process

### Fork and Pull Model

This project uses a fork and pull request model for contributions:

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Create a topic branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** in logical, atomic commits
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a pull request** against the `main` branch

### Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs/` - Documentation updates

Examples:
- `feature/add-authentication-support`
- `fix/handle-connection-timeout`
- `chore/update-dependencies`
