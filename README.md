Spec-driven infrastructure automation and orchestration — delivered by AI agents on Itential.

Most infrastructure automation is built without a delivery model. No consistent stages, no traceability, no repeatable process — just ad hoc builds that are hard to maintain, document, or hand off.

This repository introduces **Spec-Driven Development** for infrastructure automation. Every delivery follows five structured stages, with AI agents executing each stage and engineers approving the artifacts that gate the next one.

```
Requirements  →  Feasibility  →  Design  →  Build  →  As-Built
      │                │              │          │           │
  /spec-agent    /solution-       /solution-  /builder-  /builder-
                  arch-agent       arch-agent    agent      agent
      │                │              │          │           │
  customer-       feasibility.md  solution-    assets     as-built.md
  spec.md         (approved)      design.md    (delivered) (approved)
  (approved)                      (approved)
```

The result is infrastructure automation that is traceable, repeatable, and delivered faster.

## Getting Started

Install the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install itential-builder@claude-plugins-official
```

Copy an environment template and point at your platform:

```bash
cp environments/cloud-lab.env my-use-case/.env   # edit with your credentials
```

See [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) for the full setup and first delivery walkthrough.

## How to Use It

```
"I need to automate VLAN provisioning on my platform"
→ /itential-builder:spec-agent

"I have a FlowAgent that's been running in production — productionize it"
→ /itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec

"I have an existing project with no documentation"
→ /itential-builder:project-to-spec

"I want to explore what's available on my platform"
→ /itential-builder:explore

"Run a compliance check across my devices"
→ /itential-builder:itential-golden-config
```

## Skills

**Delivery**

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/itential-builder:spec-agent` | Requirements — refine use case, produce approved HLD |
| `/itential-builder:solution-arch-agent` | Feasibility + Design — assess platform, produce solution design |
| `/itential-builder:builder-agent` | Build + As-Built — implement design, test, deliver, document |
| `/itential-builder:flowagent-to-spec` | Read a FlowAgent → produce deterministic workflow spec |
| `/itential-builder:project-to-spec` | Read an existing project → produce spec + design docs |
| `/itential-builder:explore` | Auth, discover platform, browse freely |

**Platform**

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/itential-builder:flowagent` | Create and run AI agents (LLM providers, tools, missions) |
| `/itential-builder:iag` | IAG services — Python, Ansible, OpenTofu via iagctl |
| `/itential-builder:itential-mop` | Command templates with validation rules |
| `/itential-builder:itential-devices` | Devices, backups, diffs, device groups |
| `/itential-builder:itential-golden-config` | Golden config, compliance, grading, remediation |
| `/itential-builder:itential-inventory` | Device inventories, nodes, actions, tags |
| `/itential-builder:itential-lcm` | Resource models, instances, lifecycle actions |

## Spec Library

22 technology-agnostic HLD specs in [`spec-files/`](spec-files/). Each spec is ready to use with `/itential-builder:spec-agent` as the starting point for a delivery.
