3. Include in your report:
   - Description of the vulnerability

## Security Best Practices

<!-- MAINTAINER: Update the sections below for your project's technology stack. Remove items that don't apply and add stack-specific guidance (e.g., SQL injection prevention for database projects, CSRF protection for web apps). -->

- **Credentials:** Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or passwords. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- **Dependencies:** Keep dependencies up to date. Run security scans regularly and monitor advisories.
- **Input validation:** Validate and sanitize all external input at system boundaries.
- **Error handling:** Sanitize error messages before exposing them. Avoid logging sensitive data.
- **TLS:** Always use HTTPS in production environments.
- **Access control:** Follow the principle of least privilege for all credentials and permissions.

<!-- MAINTAINER: Add any project-specific security considerations below. Examples:
- Authentication/authorization requirements
- Data encryption standards
- Compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)
- Security testing tools used in CI/CD
-->
